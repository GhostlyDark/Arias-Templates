# Aria's Templates for ZZCONVERT
#### Additional models for zzconvert and fixes

# Warning: this is protected by the GNU general public licence.

If you didnt do dick to make these models dont try to claim them (the aria is technically co owned by a defunct game studio but eh). other than that as long as you post your modification source,
read the gpl3, you should be ok to do what you please. theres not really a code of conduct but i will seperate this work from yours
if you do something nuts. Im not resposible for your behavior. Nor am I policing it. Dont film dead bodies or cause a race war 
and you should be fine.

- If you are looking to use the skins all you need is the to build a.zobj and manifest.txt files (usually aria's)

- if you are looking to play around with the source files be my guest.

- if you want yours added contact me or make a pull request. (this requires posting the source files or I'm not accepting it)



## Before you complain please make sure:

  - Understand this isnt a "cool mod" repo but a template to modify

  - You decompress your rom. Adding de/recompression to zzconvert is redundant.

  - You have used the correct manifest for your purpose 

  - This DOESNT work with normal 1.1/1.2 (out of the box).

  - I realize it said 1.2 in the manifest but the debug rom is based on the 1.2 codebase

  - If you see pink use the built in texture finder.

  - Understand that 2.8 isnt supported for oot quite yet. 2.79 is best for oot for now.
  
  - Understand that 2.8 is required for sm64. The decompile is recommended but isnt required.

  - Understand that no piracy is and will be involved on my end. Buy what you modify.

  - Understand the fbi isnt going to kick down your door over emulation software. Look up bleam.
